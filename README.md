# SSH Batch Brute Force

This repository contains the source code for a SSH batch brute-force attack.

The purpose of this attack is to brute-force a set of username and password
pairs to gain access to a machine via SSH. It is a preliminary attack, so
there's not much complexity, nor do I plan to add extra complexity.
